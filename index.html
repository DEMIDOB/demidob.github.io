        <p>Hi, Dan is here talking to you. You might think you're reading this text on a webpage you've just opened, but it's wrong. I've established a direct connection to your brain and I'm transferring these words directly to your neurons tricking you into thinking that you are reading them. You're alright. Don't worry. Just play my games :)</p>
