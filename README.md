# Welcome, guest.
Dan's here talking to you. You might think you're reading this text on a webpage you've just opened, but it's wrong. I've established a direct connection to your brain and I'm transferring these words directly to your neurons tricking you into thinking that you are reading them. You're alright. Don't worry. Just play my games :)

### My games you'd consider checking out, I guess:
- [GRVT](https://grvt.dandemidov.com) — a physics-based game where you control a spaceship by spawning asteroids around you that attract the vehicle
- [The Moonminer](https://moonminer.dandemidov.com) — you are a rolling ball on the moon's surface only capable of, well, rolling following the shape of the terrain. Transform it to get away from that red alien!
