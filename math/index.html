            Very few things in the world are as beautiful as Math. I'm interested in a lot of things (I'm a math major after all). Here, I share some of my thoughts on math and publish some of my work that might be somehow interesting.

                            The question was: given a sequence with a closed-form expression for its n-th member, <b>when is it possible to give a closed-form expression for its partial sums</b>? I started exploring this as I was 16, and in this paper, I have gathered some of my findings. Not all the ideas are brand-new, but there is one thing I would strongly suggest you looking at: <b>The Cherry on Top Theorem</b> (Theorem 4.0.3)

                            We mathematically formalize the core idea of evolution—natural selection—
and show that it is not only a theory of a natural sciences but rather a logically
and mathematically accurate concept.

                            We define the concept of a special subset of vertices of an undirected graph called a clique and set the rules for when one can"jump" from one clique to another. Such a pair is called a move. An (ordered) sequence of cliques, such that every pair of adjacent cliques form a move, is called a good path if it satisfies specific properties that we define later. The goal is to establish when a good path is exists and, if so, how to construct it.
