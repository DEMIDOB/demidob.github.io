            Very few things in the world are as beautiful as Math. I'm interested in a lot of things (I'm a math major after all). Here, I share some of my thoughts on math and publish some of my work that might be somehow interesting.

                            The question was: given a sequence with a closed-form expression for its n-th member, when is it possible to give a closed-form expression for its partial sums? I started exploring this as I was 16, and in this paper, I have gathered some of my findings. Not all the ideas are brand-new, but there is one thing I would suggest you looking at: <b>The Cherry on Top Theorem</b> (Theorem 4.0.3)
